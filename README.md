# CashCalc: A Practical PWA Cash Calculator

Welcome to CashCalc, the by-product of my passion for coding and a practical need to solve a real-world problem. I created this application as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to make it easy and efficient to calculate the amount of money in a cash register - a small, but (hopefully) meaningful contribution to my girlfriend's work life.

This project was born out of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), harnessing the power and flexibility of React.

## Key Scripts 

The CashCalc project directory includes the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode. Head over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it. The page will refresh as you make changes, and lint errors, if any, will display in the console.

### `npm test`

Use this command to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. You can learn more about how tests are run [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder, bundling React in production mode and optimizing the build for the best performance. Once the build is ready, it's set to be deployed! You can read about deployment [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

Please note, `eject` is irreversible! If you're not happy with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` anytime. This will remove the single build dependency from the project, giving you full control over the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc).
